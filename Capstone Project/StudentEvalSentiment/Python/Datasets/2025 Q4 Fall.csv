The labs were cool, I liked how we were doing them over Github and working on one big lab that was gonna be changing. But then we left it behind when we got to Cassandra and never touched it again. I think the class is too fast to go over 4 databases entirely, where-as in Databases 1 we only went over one. I feel like if I want to actually use any of these databases *For example Redis, I really like Redis* then I am going to have to go back and re-learn everything on my own, because we had maybe what, 3 days to go over the databases? So I think reducing the scope of the class, and then removing research assignments and assessments *tests* and making most of the assignments on just pure straight graded labs that are hands-on and actually TEACH you how to work with databases would be better.",

The class needs to be something that builds understanding, not an exercise in how willing are you to throw your head into a wall until it stops being in the way.    Fundamentally, this class expects you to have a lot more knowledge about how to research, test, implement, and bugfix a solution to multiple complex problems. However, for me at least, those skills are not yet developed enough for this class to be a useful learning experience. Possibly pushing this class to be further out in the CS degree's plans (Year 3, possibly) would be very beneficial. Alternatively, increasing the course requirement to need more foundational skills before taking the class. The difficulty would be fine at that point, it's understanding the process of getting from start to end in the project that would be beneficial.     TL;DR: Increase the course length to a full Quarter, increase the amount of in class demonstrations, and (possibly) delay this class/give it more prerequisites. The difficulty can be changed if the prerequisites or course length can't be.",

And some lessons were taught in ways that made me question if the professor actually understood the material or if he had looked it up and taken the first link google gave him. (ie a grammar lesson in place of a logic lesson because the term we were learning happens to exist in both contexts)    * I am very sure that I understand the subject matter better than the professor and that I can teach it better as well. Not just in theory. I helped several classmates to better understand the subject when it was explained poorly by the professor.    * Feedback was oftentimes timely but was sometimes delayed or entirely absent.    * Feedback was oftentimes unhelpful and vague.    * Some assignment instructions were very unclear, and when asked for clarification, an equally unclear retelling of those instructions was given, and no elaboration was given when elaboration was explicitly asked for.    * On multiple occasions the professor said they would push back the due date on an assignment but did not.    * On one occasion the professor pushed back the due date on a lengthy group assignment as promised, but within 48 hours of the original due date, the due date was moved back to the original time causing significant issues. No announcement, email, or other form of warning was given for the due date being changed back. Several days after the assignment had been due, the due date was pushed back again.    *Grading on group presentations was inherently unequal. It was stated that presentations would be partially graded based on the feedback of the rest of the class using a series of four questions. The questions used on day one were significantly different from those used on the other days, and I suspect that the nature of the day one questions would lead to much more lenient grading for the groups that presented that day than for all other groups.

I agree and think that students should be creative, but maybe there should be a hard requirement that it isn't the same sort of application as our joke lab?

The meetings that are held with students should be more productive than 'How are you feeling on your capstone,' as students should be required to show their progress. This would allow the teacher to give feedback on the current state of the capstone as well as feel more prepared for the end, as they will know where they actually stand with respect to their capstone.

Collaboration is always an important aspect of working in most fields so it's a great skill.,I pray nobody else has to go through the issue of having an instructor that never shows up until they're replaced 2/3 of the way through the sprint. The current instructor obviously does their job (and even does it exceedingly well considering we learned exactly what we needed to.) Making sure there's a good instructor from the get-go would have been the main way to improve the experience.,
