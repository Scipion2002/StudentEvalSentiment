things know yet improved understanding somethings
think much feels like lot memorization know make feel better
love useful information going get college career intro level classes students take regardless degree great means get improve knowledge something absolutely become standard within relevant industries also love much material made think possibilities related ideas potential uses
may problem relating sensational buzzwords appealing terms lot vocabulary really hard learn due words many different regular use meanings making tricky associate properly glad teacher already stressed make total sense outside marketing perspective still ended struggling retain things
liked setup pace progress
working different linux systems helpful actually seeing differences different versions
get little depth certain linux systems working systems class not
technically includes things need set linux server
[org] hardly teaches long term skills like various minute installations configurations leave rot essentially building one done never learned would apply
curriculum really really needs revamp class teaches piss little speaking someone every assignment
many videos watched

nice learning everything however start create windows account using command console edit txt file sudden caught surprise
steady learning curve
thought rather easy however think learned linux
maybe harder assignments struggled
course fast paced coding already know made fantastic refresher
enjoyed pacing assignments
would love see labs improved people problems many labs worked weirdly bit difficult understand
liked listening class worked stuff
nothing said great
liked labs focused one task time
would like see better feedback lose points rather check rubric even though rubric explain missing also like even labs felt also love coursework updated lot based older versions [loc] assignments entirely wrong instructions
like used virtual machines
wish got class
liked straightforward assignments
nothing mentioned earlier
require coach assistance unable comment well coaches provided help
curriculum set steady pace informational
subject explored lot taught lot new things labs helpful
think labs need better worded would sometimes get stuck labs day
not like modern operating systems teacher nice would like steer clear classes similar
knew material beforehand still expanded knowledge significantly provided ample opportunity practice skills apply way benefit even course
paper bit cruel early
liked making sites html
interaction motivation feel like worth going
not class second years really give hoot
second year learned little code one boring languages known man [org]
course covered basics [org] [org] [org]
better pacing covering three coding languages
course seemed bit inconsistent week one usual syllabus intro week week given participation assignments daily homework due end day week participation assignments daily homeworks pushed aside final two weeks mainly building big project final project
lot time given assignments never felt really rushed get work done
maybe bit hand holding first week felt pretty [gpe] lost time
liked got build mock website
given quarter took course certain aspects necessary drill extremely hard remember closing bracket maybe speed parts like little bit give room going advanced aspects class
would like bit detail understand things bit better
everything messing wires fun
liked demos feedback comments projects
comments great teacher overall
liked getting preview databases
would nicer quarter long course spend time implementing real world situations databases would good fit basically spend little time learning absolute basics database whisked away next one
course pacing rated according described like see course improved [person] one academic coaches course utterly fantastic even made fully functioning demonstration [org] form video game huge props guy
course really simple
better written assignments
really like professor curriculum
liked learning data bases
think unnecessary busy work teacher didnt want forced give busy work
like learned popular database types usefull later
not like little time spent type database spent one week type three class days learning entirely material instructor needed cover class needing install new ide databases using almost every week switching database langueges every week even comfortable basics last one not condusive remembering
liked beginning used databases code
integrated usage databases would make better learning experience
liked variety databases worked
would like see script code integration databases feel like knowing basic querying useful would much better also learned link databases real applications
[person] amazing academic coach went beyond time time boy deserves raise
liked learned use several different databases
would like see less talking less important practical things like time complexity time talking database structure query
think occasionally pace bit fast class especially given not talk thing much class
liked instructor concept course idea hands learning labs databases covered
would like see research assignments removed see value feel like busywork learn much write queries felt lack luster labs cool liked [gpe] working one big lab gonna changing left behind got [person] never touched think class fast databases entirely databases went one feel like want actually use databases example [person] really like [person] going back learn everything maybe days databases think reducing scope class removing research assignments assessments tests making assignments pure straight graded labs hands actually teach work databases would better
could tell prof [person] intentional every lesson felt like purpose could also tell knew talking felt reassuring student definitely enjoyed class
needed use [org] really knowledgeable sometimes went taught class database
adding module section course page instead links homepage
dont like databases
like way course structured especially [person] taught first two days spent learning new material followed review quiz good routine allowed stress free work course
would like see course spend time individual types databases example spending weeks every kind relational database making quarter long class also believe class would benefit earlier time instead end day
assignments really easy understand practice going week
class examples working actual databases professor
playing around tons different [person]
specifically liked neo4j general
missed half class due illness take answers spoonful salt
entertaining class [person] made course extremely interactive made favorite class attending [org] far
honestly nothing class reasonably paced informing opinion
learning computer work stuff
make spare list special inputs
enjoyed course easy
would like see challenging material help grow
ease tech lits
think course good
good way wake brain start day
comment like said earlier everything well structured
like liked assignments reflecting
would like see information things non tech related finances find different clubs
thought assignments pretty easy taking minutes complete
appreciated laid framework better coping strategies dealing stress related school personal life giving chance check reflect
would liked topics cover mainly core assignments rather techlits
useful tutorial course everything else school offers
harder tech literacy assignments teach deeper aspects machines given
freedom response questions
enjoyed place week get mind right positive influence
reach coaches sure amazing
love mental preaching think important reflect improve mentally order succeed
love even reflection think extremely helpful
good foundation individuals know nothing [person]
believe class include info directly relevant [org] courses keyboard shortcuts tools like task manager cool already class types things called [org] also keyboard shortcuts especially useful wholly unnecessary success not knowing shortcuts not cause fail class success strategies focused entirely concepts tools fundamental success
introduction tech literacy
nothing useless nothing teach anything new served waste time try push poor learning habits onto
test added save money spent junk professor replaced someone idea make others feel school punish professors give harmful advice mental health
yeah course irrelevant basic unnecessary professor serves worsen
would like see tech literacy
teaches need view college order succeed
see nothing needing improvement
like simple made basic windows knowledge
nothing class think would need improvement
teacher intrigue dealing potential philosophical debates going curriculum prepared least twice rushed remainder notes lecture found caught one particular subject would discuss entire class asking questions opinions responding things could true
feel good students comfortable college yet
come college prepared psychologically class waste time
learned lot things computers like shortcuts certain applications work
provide actual success strategies like ways studying something actually lead direct success
straight forward easy
easy straight forward
liked easy chill class
would like different things person improve stay successful school rather simply going keyboard shortcuts niche things
overall really enjoyed class issues extremely easy dedicate time complete nothing extreme
taught fun concepts
would like see challenging topics brought regards academic success
wish could readily test class
learning niche keybinds [loc]
liked taught important concepts people needed
would like course test able felt like bit waste time since already fully capable knowledgeable subject matter
course incredibly easy seemed drag long considering content actually learning
course way easy honestly seemed waste time everything course could quick google search ever needed use separate course
difficulty material learned would like learned things useful dev applications toolboxes etc
see reason class needed didnt learn anything things already knew couldve gotten youtube video
liked simplicity course nice refresher comes dealing knowing basics computer
maybe fun shortcuts learn computer example students press ctrl shift say press ctrl shift great prank students
mostly good excuse stay awake early
even think coaches class also challenging mostly teaching basics windows learn new things windows swear keyboard shortcut literally anything although not hard navigate around computer
pretty boring class still helpful adjust [org] life
liked showed actually use files computer shortcuts never learned
think would great class specifically could choose self paced canvas course learn useful things could learned things assignments saved valuable travel time
faster maybe less known stuff feel like already knew taught class remember test not one maybe bit clear learn class know test not
even though already pretty experienced technology really appreciate making sure people know perform essential computer functions useful keybinds
good topics learn
really slow basic boring
hard think helped personal life
liked part stuff could love working since like people much exceptions course
nothing great think lessons quite entertaining watch
think put everything
pretty easy class take
assignments long winded really teach anything
liked easy assignments could minutes
comment felt good introductory course
already succeeded college going [org] class felt little redundant also coaches class real struggle class assignments pertaining little bit harder find ways properly completing assignment required think accurately share without sharing
super easy could assignments class get good grade
intellectually stimulating think easy
course giving enough new knowledge feel like necessary course
nothing really end
course [gpe] boring course guess
delve feel see person gave better understanding things currently improve
nothing really change lot material stuff people could already learned refresher never hurts
appreciate course longer lunch hour well fact everything covered relatively quickly class also plenty time outside class work class mondays wednesdays never felt like get overloaded classwork
reasonably challenging intellectually stimulating question said agree already known material much challenge specifically
time maybe like minutes
feel like learned much already know said useful information knew already
enjoyed time able spend hearing struggles relating others
believe best version neu100 taken
good pacing learned useful material great teacher
enjoyed tools showed well keyboard shortcuts useful likely use future
would liked see tools shortcuts utilized
good course good assignments lessons
like thumb meter
like said know improve
liked evaluations reflections done not class tech literacy also seeing adjusting [org] feeling really appreciated
lessons tech literacy understandable incredibly simple easy eyes class takes nearly hour day
liked able learn skills help make coding easier
not believe much needed nor anything
talking things school
think pretty good
know section thing gave evaluation course last section something like teacher felt truly involved learning wellbeing
see previous section
made reflect habits could cause stess
screenshot assignments could combined
made learning basic tasks computer fun entertaining
walls room otherwise not know
made reflect things need better
also not much think
like stress map assignment not stressed really hard lol
like learning void tools app
nothing teaching aspect assignments got not necessary hard tedious anything would maybe like see assignments could learn stuff knew computer shortcuts know not everyone knows navigate computer really like void tools know really useful
like much handle started missing days due work
curriculum taught good full helpful advice principles students
curriculum outlined syllabus differed little taught feel like anything necessarily missing
assignments easy teach good strategies know really helpful
class pretty good anything complain
great class fun
honestly liked course ability safe space think tech lits helped cover common things need know using windows developer thought personal assignments good
really think anything needs improved think assignments like stress map built people living campus also think way living alone especially first time scary stressful honestly think anything change something observed
anything think could improved
able talk week going learning ways make using computers easier
easy also still taught things
[org] assignments eyes perfect way introduce crucial helpful [loc] functions without taking limited class time took minutes informative forced put shortcuts taught practice assignments maybe enjoyable effective thanks habit tracker semi consistently get bed reasonable time although probably not part course curriculum [person] class let know beginning class show thumbs also helped lift bit weight chest
hoping would least little emphasis study tips especially coming high school could get little effort want see class completely saturated studying advice touch good study habits take notes lecture would nice
liked short kind laid back sense assignments short informative able discuss feelings deeper welcoming environment
felt like class work actually meaningful taken similar classes busywork
good got alot
truly focused individual students teaching new tools use help success
enjoy time [person] maybe extra day class week
like given assignments feel like busy work everything purpose
got learn lot things task manager screenshotting learned device manager never knew
not much really hard say
liked quick gave clear mind next class
would like see shortcuts
feeling like made something could potentially something make industry
stronger outlines assignments
really loved format class along assignments projects important lead much better understanding topics discussed class
maybe daily check ins
felt real project actual company nothing felt useless real world application
appreciated review [org] [org] implementation
would appreciate bit help one could use certain systems [org] apis
liked creative liberties towards project
would rather able choose group project see beneficial random groups would rather great app people trust end project
open ended everyone put effort
liked implement [gpe] since actual emerging platform
dont think mobile development much emerging platform
random group members project class makes likely group least group member nothing forces good time management work not flavor project classes
feel like lot reasons like class due placement capstone quarter class would benefit timed better
would change class quarter long class learning less throwing deep end seeing well thrash flounder class needs something builds understanding not exercise willing throw head wall stops way fundamentally class expects lot knowledge research test implement bugfix solution multiple complex problems however least skills not yet developed enough class useful learning experience possibly pushing class [org] degree plans year possibly would beneficial alternatively increasing course requirement need foundational skills taking class difficulty would fine point understanding process getting start end project would beneficial increase course length full quarter increase amount class demonstrations possibly delay class give prerequisites difficulty changed prerequisites course length
like see class quarter long possibly time assignments felt like much little especially since prospect class thrown everything also argue prerequisite classes needed really clue half time
liked working learning [gpe] enjoyed diving deeper [gpe] databases thoroughly exploring [person]
enjoy course structured labs first weeks final course next half weeks generally gave good amount time figure things without giving abundance time nothing
overall think course could benefit sort prerequisite corequisite students learn dealing large amounts data parsing uneven data [org] pages
freedom tackle real task may assigned job
precursor class would nice db3 expand current db2 course include exercise like end instructor walks process
liked usefulness material
think students would benefit previous experience subject taking course
challenged handle big data
[org] really cool guy
liked time figure solutions first two assignments fun great way get back database mindset
feel like bit much trial fire especially came wikipedia project first two projects easy manage figure little guidelines help entirety wikipedia difficult get useful work done good way force learn methods definitely stressful difficult
never interact coach really rate
encouraged study expand abilities learn topics unfamiliar told many times industry keep new technologies languages tools course great dive aspect industry take learning hands
projects complete would love review different approaches classmates well example instructor project industry standards
coach incredible always able provide valuable assistance whenever needed aside role coach also awesome person around
enjoy projects assigned first last one
dont think [org] good doesnt give data massive text wall feel like industry assigned gather data like
throw deep end drip feed need float effective learning mode
liked needed solve manage large amounts data thanks python script files use parse [org] files manage even larger files computer handle size led option filtering also led slow importing speed end led not good rather thoughts least
guidance handle large data improve import speed struggled
like free reign choice work project get task accomplished
late dont like going home especially time year already dark time
challenged knowledge databasing software
think course needs quarter long felt way tight packed
really enjoyed course challenges gave nothing straightforward point allowed creatively think grow developer
nothing course think could improved good mention brought first [org] assignment though first assignment class could last assignment databases could beneficial students entering course
liked projects mimic real world scenarios constraints
nature projects along clarity expected students
mainly neutral material
fast still eductaional
like social experiments done show different learning theories
forced comfort zone presentations
forced communicate classmates get know cohort
maybe not much psychoanalysis
every day fun day got partner new people assignments present class get rid fear
many students think class much talking however class needs someone explain everything believe class good enough
shout goat [person]
nothing course slow repetitive
pretty much course could effectively removed schedule would learned not
love course helped learn open way course made feel secure way present made feel like anyone start conversation
really fun watching different projects students fun even listening
think definitely time
another course pretty easy taught handle going college
liked applied real life actual things
enjoyed learned lectures projects fine love projects personal preference
way two solo projects like lower level requirements additional level criteria felt odd know
liked project every week
liked projects happened week though group projects
maybe day two [org] films personal preference complaint would preferred days plan film edit impossible produce something decent
coaches course appreciate lack assignments besides [org] projects
interactive assignments gave sort freedom make assignment ways wanted
nothing really class great
got lot learned lot cognitive side college fun class part projects mostly fun
think unique attribute one beginning kinda weird didnt really get much not sure guess overwhelmed first week year
introspected enjoyed completing assignments
course taught way prof [person] would able sit back not teach class
would like see less hostile friendly environment
enjoyed idea gives students different prospective
liked could get know people make new friends
would like less presentations felt like waiting lot presentations would preferred learning something new related course
fun class presentations hard think things learned class helped lot
nothing particular stood
really understand course necessary also not really call
like psychology class focused applicable knowledge whether improve everyday life character
nothing really needs change
days week canceled half time
fewer easier assignments maybe get rid together
not great class sure teacher great guy extremely unenthused
pacing assignments felt like similar
class felt repetitive
say idea supposed learn
clearer focus learning
learning different ways people thought learning effective definition structure quite interesting
anything helped find practical value theories learned much help find build learning strategies future
feel like course tailored longer period weeks lot class since material learned interesting really time learn basic introductory things learning theories given group project create good idea group project feel like helped assess understanding learn much nor help come specifically practical effective strategies learning future maybe given time course could informational well helpful new students
guess best thing came class fact finished class early every day
really know supposed course
hard feel interested something hardly feels like taught directly instead taught people
liked short professor kept class times
would like see challenging meaningful assignments challenge way think instead five assignments spammed
lot different classes gave variety
teacher kind boring monotone
liked [org] started class early discussions felt excited learn get know [org] better offer
getting early cancelled classes great happened often class turned felt like busy work thing got put effort learn
[org] teaching less busy work
liked learning history
time work final project
overall good class learned quite bit information
makes slower speed student
none professors end
enjoyed first half class learning history [gpe] training simple model fun
second half class overwhelming [org] way skill level along final project felt cluttered together paced apart explained better
liked professor seemed actually happy teaching
time management invoice class participation maybe
interested [gpe] topic enjoyed
none mind moment
four weeks history lectures one large assignment barely lectures covered requiring personal research least like two hours one quiz multiple decent sized large projects last two weeks class not great
quite easy manageable
speeches lectures way long
course good people never done research [gpe] works goal
slightly engaging already learned small bit [gpe]
less focus history bit focus neural networking
clue neural network lab lost entire time
wish learned useful stuff
content focused much history [gpe] well specific definitions everything involved fascinating philosophical topics discussions surrounding implications ideas area technology
kind slight downside open teaching style time management seemed little shaky also unforeseen incidents definitely extenuated simply root cause feeling
like reviewed history abstract concepts around [gpe] also think building model azure good allows explore higher level concepts without needing figure implementing python
think would good pop culture history little quicker way could focus machine learning also think might good explore studio super easy learn runs locally much control
long presentation history [gpe] everything else felt paced correctly even things time
feel like huge percentage class listening single presentation weeks end got really boring really learn much since kept spacing getting distracted things
feel like presentation history [gpe] felt way slow unengaging maybe kind thing along like daily quiz day coverage would good
know tech school job market [org] leaning direction believe not everyone including code nerds likes enough learn first course especially surrounding stigma around stolen data around [org] generative
enjoyed hands learning [gpe] pipelines teachable machines
would like assignments not difficult requirements put learn class day practice hopefully remember better
thought learning use [org] interesting
work time lectures little clear side tangent important
pretty fun lean part
less tangets not super specificlly topic
wish assignment learn easier hands activities instead talked
talke neural networks
history could reduced give students chance learn topics without feeling like cramned week worth time
like offered since [gpe] becoming big thing recent years useful know works learn utilize properly
maybe hands interactive activities differentiate different uses [gpe] like differentiating [org] basic enemy [gpe] game
pacing felt bit majority course history [gpe] start developing training near end quarter not lot wiggle room
learn things behind [gpe]
liked able pass despite due sick
due not able come class due sick understand classes
liked assignments directly working [gpe] like training model pipeline assignments
think assignments course work little light
coach gave good feedback feel like could opportunities communicate peers
liked used actual technology used industry
loved assignments think every assignment fun educational
useful applicable stuff
way slowly paced needs spend time windows
experimentation freedom one way accomplish task though case practically coding related class
wish class advanced advanced version depth scripting
coaches class although need personally would appreciate coaches class
hands experience came recovering troubleshooting vms
think might better work different virtual client rather [org] gave students class lots problems
like experimentation although lot things break means fixed learning experience
documentation class flux made sense
would change hypervisor something hyper
good get experience something every single business either
liked learning paperwork comes job person overall document everything
really see aspects improve course
liked case studies team documents created
assignment personally feel like much first assignment could easily broken smaller assignments make easier instructor know stage everyone help easier also case get one portion doesnt ruin entire assignment count towards one smaller assignment
liked working server room
wish stuff worked
realistic learned things applicable real life work
server blade functionality rough work students
proportionate amount assignments
publish assignments week two 8217 due
liked course dove actual [gpe] programming
would like able work ahead work busy fall behind
instructions labs could include images
liked freedom labs however bite end tried overly complex code
nothing improved faults end
like assignments beginning thus approach class pace
learned lot operating systems not know feel like things taking class
maybe shorten class make class days week feel super long boring
liked extremely easy never stress
wish assignments interactive could shown wednesdays quiz quiz review complete whole course one day not interactive
class easy boring opinion
liked taught basics anyone might not previous knowledge field
needs challenging labs really explore computer especially things like commands
like course networking windows [org]
faster pace content
liked could choose pace degree
would like see difficult assignments
experience nice however feel though content bit elementary
[org] could expand advanced topics
stated specific instructions would preferable open options using different virtual machine software since virtualbox tends little broken
relativly easy didnt take lot time
would prefer see class goes bit computers know class likely set way teach people know thing computers
quick easy work assuming understood asked could easily bolt ahead meanwhile able ask help needed
little slow could possibly sped
liked open course able complete coursework earlier covered class
think quizzes able taken certain times made frustration class required maybe students completed previous coursework quiz could get approved take quiz early student successfully completed coursework maybe would required present class take participation free leave
new teached shortcuts
taught new things linux know taught setup virtual machine
felt slow maybe something bit faster paced would better
stuff know interesting
already know lot information class since took college level class back high school related topics great refresher since essentially one whole year since also glad learned info [person] frustrating working first times never got around old self paced course
assignments content mildly outdated understand nature classes like since staying date necessitates relatively constant changes times assignment instructions clear besides way good encouragement use resources like coaches teacher walk lab need help
allowed ahead schedule long understood subject
could somewhat pace
make somewhat understandable
content interesting useful applicable revealing options tools available use
possible could cool look options potential concerns installing [person] portion current system onto new system entirely issues currently taught though
liked structured assignments spacing
would like instructions updated since seems date current models [org] machines made little clear understand since sometimes hard time understanding needed actually complete assignment
curriculum engaging gives something free time not gaming
coach pretty late grading late assignmnts know supposed turned earlier lost points
liked learning new tips tricks windows linux [org] opened lots new possibilities
wish learned depth subjects covered mentioned previously would love time prof baxter taught knowledge
would love [person]
absolutely loved learning subject putting everyday use
effectivly showed utilize manage virtual system operating system along teaching not many people used linux
think assignments updated [loc] ones still [loc] along assignments vague others ask steps actually accomplishing
liked new concepts got learn refreshing
would like see practice assessments
liked [person] kept class engaged
online coaching availability
would much like take class
friends made clear needed bit extra help error handling made extra lesson weekend work nice
would like see something try catches error handling buffered reader instead using console
labs fun challenged everything learned
loved labs provided place put effort
reason answers mainly pacing one already knew stuff taught feel like properly asses pacing course
enjoyed labs allowed level creativity despite rigid rubric long remained within bounds assignments could liked
consistency challenging wont bored beardall instructor
enjoyed going detail coding [person] specifically enjoyed learning arrays error handling
think aspects course could improved
enjoyed willingness everyone teach participate learning fun new skills
front lights back lights full lights made others tired made harder focus days
personally fast thats also something adapt
coding tests little hard understand wording little hard understand someone new computer science
pacing perfect content informative
relevant content great pacing
speed application learned
continue rad guess
liked learning code ive never done class
nothing see needs improvement
like course paced amount subject covered felt like class designed beginners taught much could time
think nothing needs improved course
cant complain anything
like course fast paced linger long given subject goal get good initial base java development course succeded
would preferred lower level language [person] however acknowledge [person] difficult language [person] popular
everything course great learned lot coaches great [person] goat
nothing much pretty well structured class
like quick waste time forced practices subject
feel like final exam fully test understanding every part material example final exam nothing regarding enums
coding really like coding
nothing good introductory course
liked academic courses lab assignments allowed put learned something practical
course effective teaching needed know
allowed learn new programming language
would enjoy sped slightly didnt show class days learned everything covered couple hours
liked guiding could better tells certain code works well others clear
think course fine
wasnt easy taught lot
nothing comes mind
easy follow yet provided challenge making something
rated course pacing neutral way college designed not think entirely reasonable learn code within months days week however able follow along well
liked quickly would topics
coaches made enjoy course curriculum
whole thing great think need improve much
easy digest understandable approach programmng
nothing improved think perfect
love fast learned stuff able continue build stuff learned rewarding class
taught rate liked stuff needed learn way understood
heard people went bit fast good though
really glad curriculum set get coding first sprint first quarter programming one thing far savvy already absolutely perfect started right away setting good expectations come even serving good way understand computer logic processes way making widely applicable towards degree paths
everything worked well fast paced learning programming fundamentals think anything would change improve
really enjoyed coding labs final code lab project
maybe labs like final lab people get freedom choose make
challenged without hard boring
pacing little quick end
see last page
always fascinated coding able learn inner workings different ways writing anything put mind exhilarating
maybe faster pacing understand slower pacing case someone experience course
stuff need learn
going stuff better
class genuinely excited learn new things loved
review many cases felt lost went topic quickly unable fully understand
hard easy follow
maybe depth explanations things work way
liked went bit easy
think course great need improved
well course fine need give 100 hats coaches amazing helpful really good helping understand concept not assignment especially [person] amazing job
coding enjoyable part comp sci opinion
said change instructor probably fits better
pacing felt really good start felt like lot work feel learning much course went assignments showed much improving quickly able move forward class really liked
liked learning new programming language speed taught
liked coding liked learning use [person] especially since felt strangely similar using [org] [org]
beginning end course beginning feels like drags little bit since takes two days actually start coding end feels little short well
part pacing felt pretty good material coaches pretty helpful assignments little easy sometimes decently challenging labs mainly challenging way helps someone improve final project fun test skill interesting come project encompasses major facets learned sprint
fast effective honestly learned way ive ever learned
coaches great helped lot needed
like see little bit string manipulation would nice
enjoyed material covered gave great challenge things study
would like cover material harder topics whether readings fixing coding problems also give small exercise professor class extra credit assignments
enjoyed learning java specifically aspect kind logic works going step step way feel like lot assignments quite bit freedom made little bit motivating
think strong foundation [person] basic concepts not adept enough know could improved first time learning java
coaches amazing really helpful
topics built concepts got harder never got lost everything taught good order also think helpful arrays taught earlier course outlined
really liked pacing class workload think challenged enough without overwhelming course perfect
coaches amazing interacted regularly labs passed comments got received grades provided helpful feedback think improved lot would without
not really anything think
loved personalization code allowing students create via personal interests definitely made retain info enjoyable experience came learning java script
many early assignments focused assessing whether student understood material giving place create something enjoy initial start fine covered curiosity want learn middle parts course assignments felt bit simple understand make sure grasp fundamentals feel little bit personalization assignments hurt
already experience [org] class similar relatively good time
time spent arrays
parts slower others faster
made laugh geuss
nothing comes mind
loved flow course coaches [person] [org] amazing coaches make much aware help
course pretty set
challenging much someone much experience code
final coding portion exam interesting feel properly prepared coding section maybe help teacher better prepare
final project let creative allowed make something proud
nothing think except instructions projects labs ome inconsistent info meant say
wonderful coaches [org] [person] great
pushes push hard
nothing actually maybe practice test second coding test students idea expect get overwhelmed much
interesting learned lot
maybe spend little time arrays
concepts learned essential useful assignments assignments tests accurately assessed critical knowledge concepts
wish covered professional standard practice organization code rules internal usage encapsulating specific pros cons cases one use instances versus static classes either viable though definitely see scope class
enjoyed really enjoyed pace class went
understand [person] chosen forces get bit works [org] think python might also good option looking towards future especially resources exist supporting python
everything felt paced correctly
lets even beginners learn code [person] reasonable pace still kept experienced coders engaged
liked lot labs thought fun code
wish also told not use array lists array lab would better prepared final
classes good teaching fun learn
presented projects could fun
learned everything needed know taught way make easy understand
liked felt slightly laid back enjoyable learning foundations coding
two thoughts improvement since quizzes happen fairly frequently end week posting anonymous not survey lists topics taught week including info previous weeks students check box feel like comfortable similar mud clear voice seen ability see everyone feels apart quiz results checking assignments publishing understand hard busy schedule many assignments retroactively edited not caught later caused lots unnecessary confusion struggle
liked paced final felt much like previous assignment think final defintely worded differently way worded sounded like search find assingment
would like see students coaching overall nothing much imporve
one best [org] miku landon second also fun making assignments chaotic need
liked coding pretty much day one first went simpler topics learning utilize tools create complex programs logic
[person] easy understand think programming language instead something commonly used industry would useful learn
appreciated learning specific information logical speech use programs like
would like see specific usages knowledge processes follow workforce
enjoyed learning truth tables believe benefit future
assignment instructions need clear direct assignments need adjusted properly address course subject rather similar things subjects things subjects similar names quizzes need adjusted properly assess material taught understand trick questions quiz context class believe belong quizzes however need follow format answer needs evaluated exact literal meaning words answer needs evaluated probable intended meaning words not always consistent
curriculum followed course objectives however one lesson grammar lesson way applicable subject matter not feel learning assessed properly instructions often vague making difficult know supposed worry get much lower score deserve due making incorrect assumptions supposed done supposed done due vague instructions lack clarification asked
cookies truth tables logically figuring
argument conclusion premise part taught asked use way feel language confusing misinterpretable
lot people class not like argumentative portion think right
course focused new side logic seen able cover content helpful insightful
told class taught weeks rather though nice able easier time class due extended timeline stated earlier content class felt not difficult depth enough warrant extended time
not make long deserves shorter period time

core class think anything changed think would interesting see something around quaternions definitely not necessary extra credit think could bevaluable since students game degree quaternion essentially rotation around non basis vector

extremely relevant material future lessons fair complexity time given completion
time final assignment many finals classes time quite hard focus final
liked ability collaborate peers create something passionate
planning day beneficial towards proper scrum agile use standup document loved much time work class explicit mention work class outside hours random group people mixed bag opinions reasoning behind valid
final review misleading asks things changed next sprint next sprint making look like questions result copying pasting rather asking hypnotically next sprint would change
freedom work projects
enjoyable course get familiar [person] test newfound skills software project
course felt extremely rushed weeks rather though group planned weeks worth content difficult keep scope within bounds would preferred entire weeks work group create complete project much substance
absolute freedom course regarding projects meaning passionate something truly cared project meant
starting examples feel like saw would change view mindsets need show expect instead facing end friday every week

like able work whatever saw fit long could feasibly something big enough deliver three sprints honestly bit refresher
liked hands could create practically anything wanted
wish check ins make sure people track people not showing class groups handling well
fun work emerging web tools
would see grading scale completely changed order provide impactful meaningful feedback addition would make grade behind points drastically change grading class would also make class requires csc260 csc280 order ensure students necessary prerequisite knowledge
course stressful multiple anxiety attacks direct result
structure class online workdays great right group competent classmates leads failure group fortunate not issue group suffered structure used would instructor take personal interest groups deem problematic people work dont grade suffer understand might take away purpose class project class way encourage less productive students checking regularly end needing extra encouragement others might need learn serious consequences boss role negative feedback teachable moment
previous comment puts together
appreciated ability work project solve problems receive guidance necessary
would like bit direction start project create
not like course
maybe solid least group ideas instructor actually give pointers like let loose little instruction
half quarter learn something brand new slap together project not enough time
liked opportunity learn framework frequently used industry alongside others
see way improve course
enjoyed self learning chance test learned
really liked building application web based really first time creating something like since project class kind hard give feedback curriculum overall fun enjoyable class
little double edged sword requirement group members operate front back end much would rather stay back end important get understanding front end works able something
fun process not picking partners forced learn diverse collaboration tactics fun explore
course passed another instructor assignments not clear seemed inconsistent requirements expectations instructor clear future reference allowing instructor ample time sort assignments course would benefit course greatly
enjoyed content course
wish quarter class not sprint
time heading back 8pm school since 9am
concept course great get put random team people work together create best product uses front end database felt lot like real world job every time showed class
preference teaches class think hindsight would liked choose group realize get choose work real life think learning environment putting students similar skill levels together gives opportunities stretch without needing consistently help teammates understand benefits personal preference
liked weekly standups trello board check ins
honestly nothing supposed project class
liked student given opportunity learn used
liked improved lot figma skills skills
want see professor change want see respectful kind good listener new professor
required store stuff
quarter long refresh topics expects know literal years since anything [org]

would like see direction start class maybe rules given operate team overall structure class
felt like needed discover things kinda fun
final actually really intresting work even involved super large database making time consuming
like fact course really hands would like maybe little bit learning project less guess wor
think course unique fun time learning discovering cool things data working data
student taking remotely would say less assignment less pass offs trying best
guess like work graded auto systems something wrong know immediately try fix
really mess course directly not much could say could improve
good class get experience [org]
like learning [org] cloud work industry standard product companies
really see improvements course
really liked [org] labs fun challenging without long boring
feel like final week little heavy probably due thanksgiving week

[org] feel like much course even talk
like teaches pros cons making big personal project

well like said maybe closer eye whats happening groups first group project basically taken bye one student head start technology able command entire project making look good rest not much
able take close look visualize changes want make thank
good introduction realizing much group projects suck future
psychoanalysis hero reworked way
crunched time good way get used dead lines
solid course nothing super bad happened
kind forced open get know people
although disliked group work end see important
enjoyed collaboration projects however personal projects favorite really let creativity flow
one main drawbacks course felt enough time learn apply material projects
material significantly intellectually stimulating previous course love value gained
honestly serviceable [org] issues think moderately tweaking future classes pandering bit better absorb material
extra days projects
felt like learning already knew class felt unnecessary
enjoyed assignments especially presentations
really care much course first enjoy working people groups grew communication ability work others even plus really fun
fine not well inversed course opinion
enjoyed course overall specific aspect jumps well done throughout
personally dislike videos video editing understand means teach course material not theater video editing class learning theories class hate videos
loved pace new concepts learned
think anything improve
begin lets start use [gpe] image generation part getting psychoanalysis hero could easily replaced assignment talking ways make character [org] mentioned came asking alternative
group assignments moderately fun actually made learn
thought course alright definitely room improvement know improve
not much fun statistical facts world around already knowledgeable much subject
get professor recognize feel way improve seem unable recognize problems instead dismiss affect banner minority coddled fragile students
mean used derogatory language referring groups fit general mean undesirable professor made angry guilty served contribute depression
really liked movie made dropping college
nothing particular previous instructor
not learned much teacher not really teach much
better quality teachers like kouler
like saved class second last week end
course nothing wast time money caused lot worry nemelka [person] made better made feel like somewhat better experience
bring back nemelka
bring back nemelka
showing one successful not give
information actual subject course
got better teacher could learn
liked easy assignments actually little fun
wish video assignment better planned
not blame teacher issues probably difficult build class absolutely nothing video assignment unnecessarily stressful
not feel comfortable giving feedback change teacher meant change curriculum part [person] informative clear
feel rushed leads back previous concerns
like course allows open public generally public speaking
original teacher not anything difficult say
two kinds curriculum one awful awful teacher one didnt get experience long enough find good bad
would like given consistently good weeks instead recieved
didnt nemelka wasnt great course doesnt pertain anything want learn cant speak much since half class didnt anything
doesnt pertain anything tech nice information know not necessary need want know
liked simplicity much closer got peers friends
cant say much [org] salvage course
proper teacher [person] good though cant hold happened aginst clas
hard really answer questions final weeks got new teacher really started learn anything
solid enough opinion
absolutely nothing course felt pointless shallow
existance would better curriculum
everything felt useless
probably choose better teachers teach [org] kinda sucked
liked saw kholer curriculum seemed cover important things help transition college
far much learning theories nemelka era
feel perhaps miscommunication teaching adjunct professor course
felt student oriented like projects based around students wanted project
felt little slow times
glad got experience working students projects general collaboration always important aspect working fields great skill
pray nobody else issue instructor never shows replaced way sprint current instructor obviously job even exceedingly well considering learned exactly needed making sure good instructor get would main way improve experience
