I helped several classmates to better understand the subject when it was explained poorly by the professor.    * Feedback was oftentimes timely but was sometimes delayed or entirely absent.    * Feedback was oftentimes unhelpful and vague.    * Some assignment instructions were very unclear, and when asked for clarification, an equally unclear retelling of those instructions was given, and no elaboration was given when elaboration was explicitly asked for.    * On multiple occasions the professor said they would push back the due date on an assignment but did not.    * On one occasion the professor pushed back the due date on a lengthy group assignment as promised, but within 48 hours of the original due date, the due date was moved back to the original time causing significant issues. No announcement, email, or other form of warning was given for the due date being changed back.

It was stated that presentations would be partially graded based on the feedback of the rest of the class using a series of four questions.
