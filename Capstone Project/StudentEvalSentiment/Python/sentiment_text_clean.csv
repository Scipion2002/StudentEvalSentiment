Course,Jeremy Stroup,PRO335-SA1 1,Persistence Project - Section A1,What aspects of this course would you like to see improved?,"I would change this class to be a Quarter-long class with more learning and less throwing you into the deep end and seeing how well you thrash and flounder. The class needs to be something that builds understanding, not an exercise in how willing are you to throw your head into a wall until it stops being in the way.    Fundamentally, this class expects you to have a lot more knowledge about how to research, test, implement, and bugfix a solution to multiple complex problems. However, for me at least, those skills are not yet developed enough for this class to be a useful learning experience. Possibly pushing this class to be further out in the [ORG] degree's plans (Year 3, possibly) would be very beneficial. Alternatively, increasing the course requirement to need more foundational skills before taking the class. The difficulty would be fine at that point, it's understanding the process of getting from start to end in the project that would be beneficial.     TL;DR: Increase the course length to a full Quarter, increase the amount of in class demonstrations, and (possibly) delay this class/give it more prerequisites. The difficulty can be changed if the prerequisites or course length can't be.",would change class quarter long class learning less throwing deep end seeing well thrash flounder class needs something builds understanding not exercise willing throw head wall stops way fundamentally class expects lot knowledge research test implement bugfix solution multiple complex problems however least skills not yet developed enough class useful learning experience possibly pushing class [org] degree plans year possibly would beneficial alternatively increasing course requirement need foundational skills taking class difficulty would fine point understanding process getting start end project would beneficial increase course length full quarter increase amount class demonstrations possibly delay class give prerequisites difficulty changed prerequisites course length

And some lessons were taught in ways that made me question if the professor actually understood the material or if he had looked it up and taken the first link google gave him. (ie a grammar lesson in place of a logic lesson because the term we were learning happens to exist in both contexts)    * I am very sure that I understand the subject matter better than the professor and that I can teach it better as well. Not just in theory. I helped several classmates to better understand the subject when it was explained poorly by the professor.    * Feedback was oftentimes timely but was sometimes delayed or entirely absent.    * Feedback was oftentimes unhelpful and vague.    * Some assignment instructions were very unclear, and when asked for clarification, an equally unclear retelling of those instructions was given, and no elaboration was given when elaboration was explicitly asked for.    * On multiple occasions the professor said they would push back the due date on an assignment but did not.    * On one occasion the professor pushed back the due date on a lengthy group assignment as promised, but within 48 hours of the original due date, the due date was moved back to the original time causing significant issues. No announcement, email, or other form of warning was given for the due date being changed back. Several days after the assignment had been due, the due date was pushed back again.    *Grading on group presentations was inherently unequal. It was stated that presentations would be partially graded based on the feedback of the rest of the class using a series of four questions. The questions used on day one were significantly different from those used on the other days, and I suspect that the nature of the day one questions would lead to much more lenient grading for the groups that presented that day than for all other groups. This is inherently unjust.",professor taught lessons ways made subject much less clear already lessons taught ways made question professor actually understood material looked taken first link google gave grammar lesson place logic lesson term learning happens exist contexts sure understand subject matter better professor teach better well not theory helped several classmates better understand subject explained poorly professor feedback oftentimes timely sometimes delayed entirely absent feedback oftentimes unhelpful vague assignment instructions unclear asked clarification equally unclear retelling instructions given elaboration given elaboration explicitly asked multiple occasions professor said would push back due date assignment not one occasion professor pushed back due date lengthy group assignment promised within hours original due date due date moved back original time causing significant issues announcement email form warning given due date changed back several days assignment due due date pushed back grading group presentations inherently unequal stated presentations would partially graded based feedback rest class using series four questions questions used day one significantly different used days suspect nature day one questions would lead much lenient grading groups presented day groups inherently unjust
